A simple weather app that displays the current weather and a 24-hour forecast for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Displays city name, temperature, weather description, and icon.
- **24-hour Forecast**: Provides hourly temperature and weather icons for the next 24 hours.

## Usage
1. Enter a city name in the input field.
2. Click the "Search" button to fetch and display the current weather and 24-hour forecast.

## API
The app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/), so youâ€™ll need an API key. Replace the existing API key in the `getWeather()` function if needed.
